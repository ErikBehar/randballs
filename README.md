## What is this ?

Balls ! Just a playground for testing stuff and performances.
Each ball can have a color that changes randomly, if it hits a ball with an other color it bounce, otherwise merge in a bigger ball.

I am using [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) for rendering and [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) for entities management and some few handmade classes that act like an "engine".


## Todo List

* Implement Quadtree for collisions check
* Endorse graphic ( switching to textures ? )
* Implement a more-likely-real collision response
* Interactive way to spawn balls


## How to build

Actually is quite simple I'll add some istruction later
